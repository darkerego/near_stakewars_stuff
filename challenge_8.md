# about

This is in referance to challenge #8 regarding the deployment of a smart contract to split reward revenues: 
https://github.com/near/stakewars-iii/blob/main/challenges/008.md

# bug

The challenge says: 
    Withdraw is succesfully distributed to 2 accounts.
    In case a bug is found, detailed feedback can alternavely be taken on count.

So this is my bug report. I am not able to create a new shardnet account in order to recieve the revenues due to this error:

<pre>
Error: The account luminaryvision2.shardnet.near wouldn't have enough balance to cover storage, required to have 1820000000000000000000 yoctoNEAR more
</pre>

Apparently new accounts no longer come with any NEAR. If this issue is fixed I will create the required accounts and complete this challenge. In this 
repo is a screenshot of the error as well.
